=== ALPHA 2 ===

Big stuff:
    - Completely redone how the persistence and update logic is handled: now it should actually do what it is supposed to!*
    - Kerbals now receive a random discount on the cost of repairing a failed part: the lower the stupidity, the higher the possible discount.
    - Introduced silent failures: if a failure is silent, you will get no notification when it happens and the part won't light up.
    - You now have the possibility to initiate the failures manually: this of course won't be in the final version, but this way you can test it and give me feedback.
    
Small stuff:
    - Control surfaces now only age in atmosphere.
    - Removed the AgeOnlyWhenActive flag
    - Fixed the bug that caused parts not updating unless they were in the active stage
    - Drastic changes in the cfgs' values
    - various bug-fixes and a lot of logging changes that don't really matter to you

*... probably
