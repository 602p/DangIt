The control surfaces age continuously because I couldn't find a way to tell when they are being used. Yet. -- UPDATE: I need to find out how to check if the ship is in atmosphere.

There is the need for a run-time blacklist of resources that must not leak.

The FixedUpdate is not run until the ship activates the first stage?
